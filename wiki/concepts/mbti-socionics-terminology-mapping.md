# MBTI ↔ Socionics Terminology Mapping

This page explains how Before We Build compares MBTI and [[socionics-model-a]] terminology without treating the systems as identical.

## Core Rule

**MBTI codes are comparative aliases, not canonical Socionics identifiers.**

In Before We Build, Socionics types should be written first with canonical three-letter codes such as `ILE`, `LII`, `ESE`, or `SLI`. MBTI labels such as `ENTP` or `INTJ` may be shown only as approximate, school-dependent navigation aids.

## Caveats: Not a Type Converter

> This page describes **heuristic mappings**, not a strict type conversion procedure.
>
> - **This is not a type converter.** An MBTI type cannot be automatically transformed into a Socionics type by a fixed table.
> - **The systems are not equivalent.** MBTI and Socionics use different theoretical frames, function semantics, and typing practices.
> - **Mappings are school-dependent.** The same MBTI type may be compared with different Socionics types depending on author, community, and method.
> - **Similar function names do not prove identical constructs.** Terms such as `Ni`, `Fe`, or `Ti` overlap historically but should not be treated as fully identical.
> - **One MBTI label is insufficient for Socionics typing.** A Socionics hypothesis requires additional evidence about stable information-processing patterns, Model A structure, communication, and behavior.

## Why Mapping Is Hard

MBTI and Socionics share Jungian ancestry and similar-looking function names, but they do not use exactly the same model.

The main traps are:

- treating `INTJ`, `INTP`, etc. as if they were Socionics codes;
- confusing legacy Socionics aliases such as `INTj` or `ENTp` with MBTI labels;
- assuming MBTI `J/P` is identical to Socionics rationality/irrationality;
- assuming `Ti`, `Fe`, `Ni`, etc. have identical meaning and placement in both systems.

## J/P vs Rationality/Irrationality

In Socionics, rationality/irrationality is defined structurally:

- **Rational Socionics types** have a rational leading function: `Ti`, `Te`, `Fi`, or `Fe`.
- **Irrational Socionics types** have an irrational leading function: `Si`, `Se`, `Ni`, or `Ne`.

In MBTI, the final `J/P` letter marks which kind of function is extraverted outward. For introverted types, this often points to the auxiliary function rather than the dominant function. This is why direct letter matching is misleading.

Example:

- `LII` is traditionally written as Socionics `INTj`, because it is a rational type with leading `Ti`.
- In MBTI-like function-first comparisons, `LII` is often compared with `≈ INTP`, not with MBTI `INTJ`.

Another example:

- `ILI` is traditionally Socionics `INTp`, because it is irrational with leading `Ni`.
- In MBTI-like comparisons, `ILI` is often compared with `≈ INTJ`.

So:

| Meaning | MBTI | Socionics |
|---|---|---|
| `J/P` letter | Which function attitude is extraverted | Legacy shorthand for rational/irrational type in old Socionics notation |
| Rational/Irrational | Not the same as Socionics R/I | Whether the leading function is rational or irrational |
| `INTJ` / `INTP` | MBTI labels | Not canonical Before We Build Socionics identifiers |
| `INTj` / `INTp` | Not standard MBTI | Traditional Socionics aliases |

## Function Names: Similar, Not Identical

The same symbols are used in both traditions, but they should be treated as related terms rather than perfect equivalents.

| Symbol | MBTI-like emphasis | Socionics emphasis | Before We Build wording |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Ti` | internal logical consistency | structural relations, classification, internal logical form | related but not identical |
| `Te` | external efficiency, execution, results | methods, technology, factual usefulness | partial overlap |
| `Fi` | personal values, authenticity | personal distance, relation, attraction/repulsion | high confusion risk |
| `Fe` | emotional expression, affect display | emotional atmosphere, visible affect exchange | related but system-specific |
| `Si` | bodily/sensory awareness | comfort, bodily state, quality of sensations | Socionics meaning is often narrower/homeostatic |
| `Se` | assertive action, impact | force, pressure, territory, resource control | Socionics meaning is often harder-edged |
| `Ni` | insight, foresight, patterns | time, tendencies, event trajectory | partial overlap |
| `Ne` | possibilities, novelty, associations | potentiality, alternatives, possible scenarios | related but not identical |

## Canonical Naming Policy in Before We Build

Use this order when writing Socionics types:

1. **Canonical Socionics code:** `LII`
2. **Full Socionics name:** `Logical Intuitive Introvert`
3. **Traditional Socionics alias:** `INTj`
4. **MBTI-like alias:** `≈ INTP`

Recommended format:

```markdown
LII — Logical Intuitive Introvert (legacy Socionics: INTj; MBTI-like: ≈ INTP)
```

Avoid:

```markdown
LII = INTJ
INTJ in Socionics
MBTI INTP converts to LII
```

## Example Alias Table

These examples are for navigation only. They are not deterministic conversions.

| Before We Build canonical Socionics code | Traditional Socionics alias | Common MBTI-like comparison | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ILE` | `ENTp` | `≈ ENTP` | common comparison, not identity |
| `SEI` | `ISFp` | `≈ ISFP` | approximate |
| `ESE` | `ESFj` | `≈ ESFJ` | approximate |
| `LII` | `INTj` | `≈ INTP` | introvert J/P inversion risk |
| `EIE` | `ENFj` | `≈ ENFJ` | approximate |
| `LSI` | `ISTj` | `≈ ISTJ` | approximate, still not identity |
| `SLE` | `ESTp` | `≈ ESTP` | approximate |
| `IEI` | `INFp` | `≈ INFP` | approximate; school-dependent |
| `SEE` | `ESFp` | `≈ ESFP` | approximate |
| `ILI` | `INTp` | `≈ INTJ` | introvert J/P inversion risk |
| `LIE` | `ENTj` | `≈ ENTJ` | approximate |
| `ESI` | `ISFj` | `≈ ISFJ` | approximate |
| `LSE` | `ESTj` | `≈ ESTJ` | approximate |
| `EII` | `INFj` | `≈ INFJ` | approximate; often disputed with INFP-style descriptions |
| `IEE` | `ENFp` | `≈ ENFP` | approximate |
| `SLI` | `ISTp` | `≈ ISTP` | approximate |

## Practical Guidelines for Tests and UI

For user-facing tests, prefer:

- `LII`, `ILE`, `SLI`, etc. as primary Socionics output;
- optional MBTI-like alias in parentheses with `≈`;
- a clear note that MBTI aliases are approximate;
- no use of MBTI `J/P` to explain Socionics rationality without caveats.

Good UI examples:

```text
LII — Logical Intuitive Introvert (≈ INTP)
ILI — Intuitive Logical Introvert (≈ INTJ)
```

Bad UI examples:

```text
Your Socionics type is INTJ.
LII = INTJ.
MBTI INTP means Socionics LII.
```

## Strong Non-Claim

This mapping is a terminology bridge. It does **not** claim that MBTI and Socionics describe identical psychological functions, nor that a stable one-to-one empirical conversion exists.
